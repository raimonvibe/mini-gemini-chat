# Mini Gemini Chat

A **super simple chat app** that lets you talk to Google’s **Gemini AI**.  
This project uses a Node.js + Express backend and a very minimal HTML frontend.  
It’s designed for beginners — no complicated setup needed.

---

## 🚀 What you’ll get
- A tiny chat interface in your browser
- Messages sent safely to a Node backend
- Backend calls **Google Gemini** and sends replies back to the browser
- Your API key stays private (never exposed in the browser)

---

## 🛠️ Setup instructions (beginner-friendly)

### 1. Install Node.js
If you don’t have Node.js yet:
- Download it from 👉 [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install the **LTS version** (the one marked “Recommended for most”)

After installation, check:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

Both should print a version number.

---

### 2. Download this project

Unzip the `mini-gemini-chat.zip` file you downloaded.
Then in a terminal, go inside the folder:

```bash
cd mini-gemini-chat
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

Run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs the libraries the project needs (Express, dotenv, Gemini SDK, etc).

---

### 4. Get your **Gemini API key**

1. Go to 👉 [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. In the top right, click your profile picture and choose **Get API key**
4. Create a new key (free quota available!)
5. Copy the long string of letters/numbers — that’s your **API key**

---

### 5. Add your API key

Inside this folder, copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` in a text editor and paste your key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

---

### 6. Run the app

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If successful, you’ll see:

```
Mini Gemini chat listening on http://localhost:3000
```

Open 👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
You now have a working **chat with Gemini** 🎉

---

## 📂 Project structure

* `server.mjs` → Node.js server (keeps your API key safe)
* `public/index.html` → very small chat UI
* `.env.example` → file where you store your API key (rename to `.env`)
* `package.json` → project settings & dependencies
* `README.md` → this guide

---

## 💡 Tips

* Don’t share your `.env` file (it has your private key).
* You can change the model in `server.mjs` from `"gemini-1.5-flash"` to `"gemini-1.5-pro"` for better quality (slower, higher quota usage).
* This project is intentionally **minimal** — you can later expand it with React, streaming, or a database.
